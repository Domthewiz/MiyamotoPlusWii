# Miyamoto+Wii
Miyamoto+Wii is a patch for the Miyamoto editor.
This patch is merged with `Tsuru` and `Baron's patch`
the .typf files are tachyon patches for the 1.3.0 NSMBU standalone copies ( excluding JP region sadly )
Some of the restored sprites require the custom code patch to work. ( mushroom blocks, and the rolling hill with pipe )
